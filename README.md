# Zenva-Python-CrossingGame
Source: Zenva Academy

# Summary 
A simple object orient program game to help visualize and learn syntax in Python. The game pretty has the same implementation as the JavaScript crossing game. The goal of the game is to let the main character, the guy with the blue shirt, reach the treasure chest while avoiding the randomly moving green blob that are on the way by moving the character with the basic arrow keys where the character can move up and down.

# Implementations
- imported pyGame to create our game background
- implemented the K_UP and KEYDOWN functions in order to move the object using the arrow keys
- implemented the detect_collision function to avoid character objects to go out of the frame
- implemented the draw function to update and draw our obejcts in the frame
